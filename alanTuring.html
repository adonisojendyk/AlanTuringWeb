<p>	Born on January 23, 1912, was a man who would change history 

and the development of technology forever. Alan Mathison Turing grew 

up, with his brother, in various foster homes in England while his 

parents worked in India. He grew a love for science and applied 

sciences. Later he was admitted into Sherborne School where he met a 

Christopher Morcom. Christopher gave Alan intellectual companionship 

until his death from tuberculosis three years later. Alan's friend's 

death drove him to do what "Christopher could not do" and drove him 

into physics. </p>
<p>	Turing moved onto Cambridge college where he switched from emotional to intellectual enquiry. His homosexuality became a part of his identity during this time as well. After a question was posed during a lecture Alan attended, he got the idea for the “Turing Machine”.  Later on during the second World War, Alan joined the British cryptanalytic department working to break the German Enigma code. He was awarded the OBE, Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire,  for his service to his country. 
</p>
<p>Alan Turing moved on to working in cryptography in The Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ. When his lover broke into his home, he reported it to the police who began to investigate. Policemen found the relations between Alan and his lover and arrested Alan. They found him guilty of “gross indecency” in court and he was given the choice between prison or one year of hormonal injections. He chose the hormonal injections, so he could continue his work, but was barred from working at the GCHQ. Two years later, Alan was found dead in his home. It is unknown if Turing committed suicide or if his death was an accident because of his work with chemicals. Alan Turing was pardoned by the Queen of “gross decency” 60 years after his death. </p>
